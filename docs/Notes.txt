The repsitory is based on a template so many parts are not filled.
Get an overview of the structure by reading the README.md. It might not be completely up to date.


Model Information
The model should use Baysian Optimitiation to find the highest Temperature on a world map.
It gets "x" guesses and gets a standardized value after each guess.
The map is 2D.
Read weather_api.py
Also read main.py.
The model should use the functions from the seperate file weather_api.py.
Keep the code simple and the structure clean.
Remember to use comments throughout the code.


Input:
- Temperature is standardized to [0, 1]
- Axis bounds (so the model knows where it is allowed to sample)

Internal:
- Gaussian Process with Squared Exponential kernel

Output:
- Guesses and their order
- Best guess

Create a config.yaml file whereever it makes the most sense.
The following variables should be placed in the config.yaml file so they can be modified there:
- Kernel Variance
- Noise parameter
- Number of allowed guesses
- Lengthscale
- Exploration
