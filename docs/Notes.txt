Model Information

Input:
- Temperature is standardized to [0, 1]
- Axis bounds (so the model knows where it is allowed to sample)

Internal:
- Gaussian Process with Squared Exponential kernel

Output:
- Guesses and their order
- Best guess


The following variables should be placed in a separate configuration file so they can be modified there:
- Kernel Variance
- Noise parameter
- Number of allowed guesses
